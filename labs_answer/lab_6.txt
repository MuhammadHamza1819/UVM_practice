Task 1: UVM Testbench Block Diagram and TLM Usage
UVM Testbench Structure & TLM Usage
A typical UVM testbench consists of the following components:

 Test (test) → Controls the test execution.
Environment (env) → Contains all components like producer and consumer_wrapper.
Agent (Optional, Not Present Here) → Manages sequence generation and drivers.
 Producer (producer) → Generates data and sends it using TLM (Transaction-Level Modeling).
 Consumer (consumer) → Receives data using TLM interfaces.
 Consumer Wrapper (consumer_wrapper) → Acts as a bridge between the producer and consumer.
 TLM Interfaces:

uvm_analysis_port (Producer to Consumer Wrapper)

uvm_analysis_export (Consumer Wrapper to Consumer)

uvm_analysis_imp (Consumer receives data)

Task 2: Code Analysis Based on the UVM Block Diagram
Code Components & TLM Usage

Component				TLM Used							Purpose
Producer (producer)			uvm_analysis_port #(seq_item) a_put;				Sends transactions (data) to Consumer Wrapper
Consumer Wrapper (consumer_wrapper)	uvm_analysis_export #(seq_item) a_export;			Connects producer to consumer
Consumer (consumer)			uvm_analysis_imp #(seq_item, consumer) a_imp;			Receives transactions from Consumer Wrapper
Environment (env)			Connects producer.a_put → consumer_wrapper.a_export		Ensures correct data flow
Test (test)				Instantiates env						Runs the test

Data Flow in This Testbench

Producer (producer) generates a random transaction (seq_item).
Producer sends data using a_put.write(req).
Consumer Wrapper (consumer_wrapper) receives data via a_export.
Consumer (consumer) gets data via a_imp.write(req).
Received data is printed in consumer.

Conclusion

TLM (Transaction-Level Modeling) is used to transfer data between producer and consumer using UVM ports.

Analysis port (a_put) sends data from producer.

Analysis export (a_export) allows consumer wrapper to forward transactions.

Analysis imp (a_imp) enables consumer to receive data and process it.
